# Coding Best Practices
for React projects in TID

## Setting up your code Editor

##### Install an automatic formatter and configure it to format-on-save
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) is the most popular formatter for VSCode
  


## HTML

##### Associate labels with inputs explicitly with `for` 
See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label#for


## CSS

##### Name your CSS classes with kebab-case 
- this is best practice
- consistent with css property names (e.g. `background-color`)
See: [CSS naming-conventions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-naming-conventions-that-will-save-you-hours-of-debugging-35cea737d849/)


#### Don't define styles inline. but do it in the CSS


## Javascript

##### Variable names are camelCase 
- local variables
- parameters
- everything else besides class names
See: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp

##### Component and file in which it is defined should have the same name
- this makes code navigation easier
