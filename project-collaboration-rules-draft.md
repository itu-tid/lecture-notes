*draft - work in progress*

collaboration
- everybody should be responsible with parts of the code - at least one main screen
- you can not be the CSS expert that supports the JS expert
- we do not want to see neither
	- people not coding 
	- nor people coding everything

if you're too good, don't just carry the project alone, carry the others; the final grade will be for the work of the team; 

the team work gives the main component of the grade
- the individual examination will move up or down, normally one grade up or down
- unless you are really bad, case in which you might fail

more is not necessarily better
- good quality we will like even more than bad quality but a lot 
- a solid and clear implementation of your four main screens is better than having eight bad screens
- we want to see that you understood the concepts and just one more screen is not going to impress us; at the same time, we will appreciate if you can do a good job well, and you do implement more; but rather go slow and do a good job; 

exam 
- i will point at code, and i will want you to explain the concepts - that you should know if it's your code or not
- surely your own code you should undersatnd in detail
- theoretical questions are also in the exam but not about the code
-
