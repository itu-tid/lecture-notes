# Presentations

Selected based on our estimation of who got farthest: 
- Group 2 - Johanna, Aja, Chloe, Sara
	- they need to refresh by hand
	- they should create an actual account
	- they should really tell a story -- their two kinds of account are quite critical
	- 
- Group 6 - Michaela, Kristoffer, Cecilie, Christoffer
	- using parse and rest
- Group 7 - Frederik, Ann, Emil, Jonas
	- 
- Group 8 - Viktoria, Luna, Maria
- Group 10 - Wassim, Kristin, Sofia, Louise 

take away
- have a story - rehearse it
	- steve jobs
	- google demos
- use real data 

# Exam Preparation

## Report Structure

*Note*: report is written for a fellow technical-interaction designer. It's not a scientific report, no citations or theory. Just your solutions. 

- **Title page** - project name, participants, names, emails
- **Project Description** (one page) -  what did you set out to achieve
- **Initial Design** (a few pages) - highlight the essential screens from *Figma* - you can also link to the actual design, but in the case the examiner has to read the report on a plane, they should be able to get an idea of your design. So the report should include the main screens of your design. 
- **Usability Testing Results** (one or two pages) - results of your usability testing
- **Implementation**
	- Link to the GitHub repository
	- Link to your Back4App database 
		- invite mlun@itu.dk and emilholmegaard@gmail.com who is your external censor
	- An ER diagram of your data model 
	- Instructions on how the examiners can run your code
		- Normally you already have a `README.md` file in the root of your repo that explains how to run the code
		- However, in the case you have any secrets that are needed for running your code, include them in the report. E.g., if the content of an `.env` file that contains `APP_JS` and other secrets and configurations is required, but is not committed to GitHub, then include the contents in 
		- If you already created some accounts for the the examiners (this makes sense in some applications, but not in others) provide this information also
- **Reflection** (2 pages max)
	- Looking back at your project, 
		- What worked well?
		- What could have been done better (both by the team and by the TID staff)

## Exam structure
- **Demo** (5-7min max)
- **Mini presentation** (5-7min max) with 
	- Corrections or completions to the report
	- Lessons learned
	- Late changes to the code (e.g. changes that were done after the submission date that we might have not seen; realistically I don't think we're going to look at the code more than one week before the oral exams)
		- bug fixes 
		- finalizing features
- **Group discussion** (10 - 30 min)
- **Individual examination** (15 min)
- **Feedback**

## Example Questions
- Regarding your code
	- Where is *this particular feature* implemented?
	- What does *this code* do?
	- How could *this code* be written better?
	- This bug that we just saw in the app. Where would you start fixing it?
	- *This piece of code*: when is it called? 
	- This feature - how is it modeled in the database? 
	- What is the part of the code that you yourself wrote and you are most proud of? 
- Regarding your design
	- What are some of the limitations of the design on *this particular* screen?
	- What visual design principles are used on *this particular* screen? 
- Regarding design processes
	- How do you organize a usability testing? 
	- How do you prioritize the results of a usability test? 
- General application architecture
	- For what kinds of computations do we need to write code that *runs on the server*? (How do you do this in Parse?)
	- What is the N+1 Select Problem? How do you avoid it in Parse? 
- React-Related
	- How is routing implemented in React?
	- How can you protect a route in React such that it is not available to a user who is not logged in? 
	- What and why are hook in Rect? Which are the most used and how do they work? 
	- How to run some code at the creation of a component? 
	- How can you reuse code with a custom hook? Do you have an example from your codebase? 
- Parse-Related
	- How do you model a one-to-many relationship in Parse? Example from your project? 
	- How do you secure the data of your application in Parse?






## Project Work After Today
- We will provide one final PR review
- We expect you to take into account the recommendations. 
- You can still fix bugs or even finalize features till the day of the exam



# Course Evaluation
- Let us spend 10 minutes on filling the official form

# Good bye
- I've been teaching React for four years now - and I'm still learning 
	- Teach yourself programming in 20 years
		 vs. 
	- Teach yourself programming in 21 days
- This is difficult stuff 
	- We were sitting with my research assistant extracting a (quite complex) custom hook and after 30 minutes we were proud of ourselves
	- In my experience frontend is more complicated than backend; but if you love it, it's awesome; because you get to create things
- I hope that between you and React *this is beginning of beautiful friendship* (movie recommendation: *Black Cat White Cat*)
- Thanks for participation
- Thanks to TAs for the help
- Good luck with your future
