# Advanced Backends


Discussion in class
- How do you handle user login? 


How do you prevent unauthenticated users from accessing certain routes? 

## APIs 

- What does API stand for?
	- Application Programming Interface


- What kind of entities have APIs?
	- API of a class = the public methods in that class
	- API of a package = the public classes and functions in that package
	- [Many](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) Browser APIs  (also called WebAPI sometimes)
	- Web APIs -- HTTP methods that can be accessed over the web

- Why does one need API keys in Web 

- What are REST APIs?
	- A special kind of Web APIs that are served over HTTP 
	- Work well for CRUD apps
	- E.g., with a `/move` endpoint, you can have all kinds of operations for a movie


## Cloud Functions 

- What are they?
	- Functions that you can run that do computation on the server 
	- They make sense in the context of ParsePlatform
	- Concept not necessary if you manage your own server

- When to use them?
	- Complex calculations (e.g. average movie reviews)
	- Calling 3rd party APIs that require secret keys (e.g. Google Translate)
