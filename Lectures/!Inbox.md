Two types of logic inside React components:

1. **Rendering code** => a transformation from props & state into JSX. This is *purely functional code*  -- for the same props and state it will always return the same JSX. 
2. **Event handlers** => functions that do things -- change state, submit HTTP POST request, navigate to another screen, interact directly with the DOM (e.g. change page title)
