# Running Code Server-Side

## Code That Does not Run on the Client

One of the nice things is that with Parse we did not have to implement a server. 

All the code runs on the client side until now. `Parse.Query`, `Parse.Object` - they're APIs that run in the context of our Application. 

However, for some things, we will need a server.

### For what kinds of computations do we need to write code that *runs on the server*?
- complex calculations on the server side that would be too expensive to run on the client side
- statistics that might involve the data of all the users (e.g., average rating of all the movies in the database; one does not want send all that data to the client; it is good to do the calculations on the server)
- calling 3rd party APIs (especially those that require a secret API key that can't be hardcoded in the Javascript)
- making a check before a user writes something to the database or updating some other metadata after a write is done.

To think about: Examples of computational tasks from your own project that 

### Cloud Functions in Parse

In Parse, cloud functions are
- defined on the server that are run in the context of the server
- called from the JS client by name with parameters

Example of cloud function called from the client: 
```js
const params = {movie: "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"};
const ratings = await Parse.Cloud.run("totalCounters", params);
```

Such a function assumes that on the server the implementation of the `averageStars` is present. A possible implementation could be: 

```js
Parse.Cloud.define("averageStars", async (request) => {

	const query = new Parse.Query("Review");	
	query. equalTo ("movie", request.params.movie);
	
	const results = await query. find();

	let sum = 0;
	for (let i = 0; i < results.length; ++i) {
		sum += results [i].get ("stars");
	} 

	return sum / results.length;
});
```

Observe in the function implementation the following:
- we can still use the `Parse.Query` API
- the params sent from the client are stored in the `request.params`
- the function is defined as `async` so it's returning a promise

To declare cloud functions in Parse one has to go to the `Dashboard`> `Cloud Code` and add it to the `main.js` file under the `cloud` folder. (see [example](https://www.back4app.com/docs/get-started/cloud-functions)). Once declared, you have to use the `Deploy` button at the bottom of the editor. 


**How can you automatically run a function on the server before a user makes a write to the database?**
- the `beforeSave` method of `Parse.Cloud`, e.g.

```js
Parse.Cloud.beforeSave ("Review", (request) => {

	const comment = request.object.get ("comment");
	
	if (comment. length > 140) {
		// Truncate and add a ...
		request. object. set ("comment", comment.substring (0, 137) +
		" ...");
	}
});
```

To think about:
- what does the above code do? 
- how could a user abuse your system if you don't implement the above code?
- if you check for comment length in JS in the UI of your application... why would you still have to check right before saving a review also on the server?


**How can you define a function that is automatically called *after* a user makes a write to the database?**

```js
Parse. Cloud.afterSave ("Comment", (request) => {

	const query = new Parse.Query ("Post");
	
	query.get(request.object.get("post").id)
		â€¢then (function (post) { post.increment ("comments");
			return post.save ( );
		})
	
	.catch (function (error) {
	
	console.error ("Got an error " + error.code + " : " error .message);
	
	});

});
```
What does the above code do?
