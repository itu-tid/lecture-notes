# Consistency and standards

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

When we talk about consistency and standards, what
we mean is that words, situations, actions and
affordances should mean the same thing across
different elements within your app, and across
multiple platforms. 

## Examples

## Mircea

Strange inconsistent printer dialog

### Vibeke
The add date read pop-up box on the goodreads.com website has two options of stopping the action happening, there is no indication of the difference between close and cancel. This creates a illusion that there is a difference between the two options, when in fact they result in the same action.
