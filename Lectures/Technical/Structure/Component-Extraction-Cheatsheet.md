# Component Extraction Cheat Sheet

One page, for when you are reviewing a pull request, your own or a teammate's. The reasoning behind it is in [Finding the Components](Finding-the-Components.md), [Pulling Out the Service Layer](Pulling-Out-the-Service-Layer.md) and [Code Organization](Code-Organization.md); the examples are all from `todo-26`.

## Every pull request is judged against the same five questions

From this week on, this is the review checklist. Before you approve a pull request, you should be able to answer *yes* to all five:

1. **Small components.** Does each component do one job, with everything in it at the same level of abstraction?
2. **State where it belongs.** Is every piece of state in the lowest component that needs it, and no lower?
3. **Clear names.** Do components have nouns for names and handlers verbs, and does every name still fit every place it is used?
4. **Parse behind a service.** Does only `services/` import Parse?
5. **No needless dependencies.** Is every new package in `package.json` worth what it costs? (See [Libraries](../Tooling/Libraries.md).)

*State where it belongs* gets its full answer in week 10, with [lifting state up](Refactoring-by-Extracting-Components.md#where-the-state-goes). Until then: if two components need the same state, it lives in their closest common parent.

## Extract a block when it repeats, or when you can name it and the page reads better without it

```
Is this JSX the same thing, drawn more than once?
├─ YES → extract it, and name what it draws                  (MyListRow)
└─ NO  → Can you name it in a word or two, as a thing?
         ├─ YES → Would the page read better with just the name?
         │        ├─ YES → extract it
         │        └─ NO  → leave it where it is
         └─ NO  → it is not one thing yet; leave it, or split it
```

When unsure, leave it. Extracting later takes five minutes; a component nobody needed stays forever.

## Four tests catch most bad extractions

| Test | Ask | In todo-26 |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | Can you name it as a thing, in a word or two? | `SharedListRow`, not `LeaveButtonAndStuff` |
| **Halves** | Would either half be useful on its own? Then it is two. | `AddForm`'s input and button: no, so one |
| **Repeat** | Is it drawn more than once? | `MyListRow`, once per list |
| **Level** | Is everything in the parent at the same level of abstraction? | `Home` after: headings, rows, a form; no `.get("owner")` |

## An extraction moves JSX, and whatever it used from outside becomes a prop

1. **Cut** the block of JSX out of the parent.
2. **List** everything it used and did not define itself: variables from a `map`, the parent's props, handlers. Each one becomes a prop.
3. **Leave the state** where it was, unless only the new component uses it.
4. **Leave the `key`** on the call site, in the `map`; it belongs to the list, not the row.
5. **Click through** the app. The behaviour must not change.

```jsx
// before, in Home
{lists.map((item) => (
  <div key={item.id}>
    <Link to={`/lists/${item.id}`}>{item.get("name")}</Link>
    <AddForm onAdd={(username) => onShare(item, username)} buttonLabel="Share with (username)" />
  </div>
))}

// after: item and onShare were used from outside, so they are the props
{lists.map((list) => (
  <MyListRow key={list.id} list={list} onShare={onShare} />
))}
```

## The same mistakes show up in every review

| Mistake | Why it hurts | Instead |
|---|---|---|
| A component named for an action: `ShareList` | It names the button's job, not the thing on the screen | `MyListRow`, with `handleShare` inside |
| A name that stopped fitting: `NewTodoForm` used to share lists | The name lies to the next reader | Rename it when its job grows: `AddForm` |
| `useState` moved into an input wrapper | The parent can no longer read or clear the value | The parent keeps the state; the wrapper takes `value` and `onChange` |
| `onChange={onChange}` on a wrapped `<input>` | The parent gets an event where it expected text | `onChange={(event) => onChange(event.target.value)}` |
| A query in a click handler | The component knows how the database works | A function in `services/`, named in the app's words |
| `alert` in a service | The service decides how the UI reports errors | The service throws; the component catches and tells the user |
| The page's heading inside `ToDoList` | The list cannot be drawn without the title, nor the title with anything else | The page draws the heading; `ToDoList` draws the list |
| A component for every `<div>` | Clutter, for nothing | The [stopping rule](Finding-the-Components.md#start-by-drawing-boxes-on-the-app-you-can-already-see): extract when it repeats |
