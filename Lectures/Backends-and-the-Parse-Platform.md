# Backends and the Parse Platform

## Backends

- What is a backend?
	- Defined in opposition to the front-end
	- The server side in a ***client-server architecture***


- What are the responsibilities of the backend?
	- authentication (proving that a user is who they say they are)
	- session management
	- business logic and DB access
	- scheduled jobs (e.g., `cron`)
	- authorization (what can a user do)


- Deploying and implementing a traditional backend
	- machine setup
	- operating system
	- security & firewall
	- DBMS
	- web server
	- API 
	- logging and analytics
	- backup system


- **Low-code backends**
	- Common solutions for common backend problems
	- Alternatives
		- Firebase = proprietary & hosted by Google
		- Azure = Microsoftâ€™s version 
		- **Parse Platform** = open source 


## Parse Platform

Our recommended low-code backend
- Implementation language
	- JS 
	- Runs on Node
- History
	Startup => Facebook => open source
- Functionality
	- Authentication
	- File storage
	- APIs (REST & GraphQL)
	- Javascript wrapper library
	- Cloud functions
	- Authorization


### Using Parse from Back4App

- Where is the Parse server?
	- You can run on your own machine (with docker; setup can be complicated)
	- In your own cloud server
	- On somebody else's server (cloud) => back4app.com 


Steps to start working with the Back4App Parse deployment 
1. Create an account on Back4App
2. Create a database for your application in Back4App
4. In your own project, install the `parse` library from `npm`
5. Initialize the (global) Parse object in your application (see step 4 in the [back4app guide](https://www.back4app.com/docs/react/quickstart))
 
Now you can interact with the database from within React in the following ways: 

### Saving a New Object to the Database

```javascript

import Parse from 'parse';

const Task = Parse.Object.extend("Task");
const task = new Task();

task.set("name", "Backends");
task.set("isDone", false);

task.save().then(
	(newTaskObject) => {
		console.log("saved with id: " + newTaskObject.id);
}, (error) => {
	console.log(error.message);
})
```

Note: 
- Creating a class for the object
- `save()` - sends the data to the server
- `save.then( (obj) => {...})` - save returns a *promise*
- The Task class was automatically created in the database if it didn't exist

### Crud Operations with Parse 
- [CRUD operations](https://www.back4app.com/docs/react/data-objects/react-crud-tutorial) (30min read)
	- CRUD = **Create, Read, Update, and Delete objects to/from the DB**

### Modeling Domains with Parse

To be able to design a database model for your application domain you must understand: 
- [Basic Data types](https://www.back4app.com/docs/react/data-objects/react-data-types) (read the examples; approx. 15min)
- [Relationships](https://www.back4app.com/docs/react/data-objects/relationships) (study this; approx. 30min)

From the Relationships tutorial 

### User Management with Parse

Parse helps you manage user accounts.
